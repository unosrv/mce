# Project Brief

## Project Overview

- Build a SaaS platform that measures greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farms (Korea/USA/Brazil) and automatically generates carbon emission reports
- Farmers input livestock information, feed, housing environment, and manure management data; the system calculates emissions using IPCC Tier 2 methodology and provides reports

## Required Components

- Web front-end development
- Back-end development
- Admin panel development
- Server/DB/infrastructure configuration

## Supported Platforms

- PC Web (no mobile support)

## Development Environment/Languages

- Language: Node.js or Python (no other languages)
- DBMS: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Please propose additional stack components

## Materials Provided by Client

- Detailed work specification (A4, 3 pages)
- ERD
- Figma design (to be provided)

## Core Features

### User Authentication
- Email-based login
- Nickname usage

### Farm Management
- Multiple farm registration
- Country-specific address input (Google Maps)
- Fiscal year configuration

### Livestock Group Management
5-step input form:

1. **Basic Information**: Species/head count/weight/milk yield
2. **Feed**: Maximum 10 items, preset support, additives
3. **Housing Environment**: Monthly ratio of barn/exercise yard/grazing
4. **Barn Information**: Area/temperature/type
5. **Manure Management**: Branching logic (anaerobic digester/solid-liquid separator/treatment system)

### Emissions Report
- Automatic generation per farm
- Emissions by category (enteric fermentation/manure/feed/energy)
- Detailed breakdown by livestock group
- PDF export

### Dashboard
- Overall farm statistics
- Monthly trends
- Farm-to-farm comparison

## Required Qualifications

- Team capable of short-term development (3 weeks)
- Experience implementing complex business logic (mandatory)
- Database design capability (22 tables, complex relationships)
- Multilingual service development experience (English/Korean, automatic unit conversion, etc.)
